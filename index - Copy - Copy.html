<h4> The movie War Dogs we as viewers are delighted to a soon to be classic film that is one of O'KeefeGeeks all time favorites. Famous actors Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, and Bradley Cooper deliver a genius performance directed by Todd Phillips in this action packed film focused on... selling guns and bullets. Yes I know it doesn't sound very exciting but this story has more depth than one would think. This film begins as our boy David realizes that he really hates his job as a masseur and believes that it is not what he wants. He tries to immediately find another job selling beds (doesn't work) but he eventually ends up with his high school close friend Efraim Diveroli. After a scene in which Efraim scares off a group of scamming drug dealers. He proposes an idea to David: arms dealing. this idea is obviously foreign to David but after some covincing he agrees.</div>
<div id= "block-two">
<h4>Many smiles and thousands of dollars later (+ David lying to his wife as to what his job is) our characters run into their first major challenge. As David is jusst chilling eating dinner with his friends he and Efraim recieve a call telling them that a plane with their cargo on it has been seized in Kyrgyzstan. Military officials are hitting Davids line about these missing guns and David and Efraim come to the realization that they are impact players in the Afghanistan War. Following this stunning realization Efraim proposes the only solution to this issue: going to the war ridden Middle East to physically deliver these guns to a US military base in a dangerous area. David now has to reveal to his wife that he is selling guns and bullets to the US army to support his family. He also has to explain that he is going to the Middle East for this job, or does he....... anyways Efraim and David venture out of the country and into the danger zone. </div>
<div id= "block-three">
 <h4>Here they come to another painful realization, in order to complete their mission they have to drive the cargo across borders to a US army camp by themselves and saying no is not an option. Here they meet Marlboro (their designated driver, kind of) and he essentially is the only way to cross the borders safely. Here our boys put their full trust in Marlboro and get in the cargo truck. Here David and Efraim experience the consequences of their actions for the first time as they get chased by a group of shooters and almost die attempting to cross borders. But eventually, after many obstacles David, Efraim, and Marlboro arrive at the US military base to deliver the cargo. Here they are praised and awarded for their work and our boys yet again, are all smiles. Until one fateful day. This mission David and Efraim had just completed was very impactful to their careers as arms dealers and due to that a new challenge was dawned upon the boys: The Afghan Deal. This was a $300 million contract that David and Efraim now had a chance to get. To do this they had to travel into the depths of Albania and export millions of bullets to the US. However one man stands in their way... Bradley Cooper, otherwise known in this film as Henry Girard. He gains the trust of our two characters and then snaps it in half as he abducts David in Albania and takes action as our boys realize the bullets are fraudulent. This film ends in a dramatic way as David and Efraim collapse as a duo and ultimately lose their families and livelihoods due to criminal charges.</div>
 
<h4> I would give War Dogs by Todd Phillips a 8/10 rating due to the amount of emotion and real world value placed in the lives of these semi comedic characters. This film is based on a true story as David and Efraim are REAL PEOPLE (I hope Marlboro is real too) and Phillips does a great job capturing the emotional swings and intensity of this story. This movie is great for most audiences though some elements of the story may fly over little kids heads, and the story of David and Efraim is one everybody should know and learn from. I mean hopefully not many people are in this type of situation but there are still lessons to be learned! - O'keefeGeek          </h4>
