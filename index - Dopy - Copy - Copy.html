        <h4>
            I'm doing a different type of review here as I am talking about Tim Burton's famous movie The Nightmare Before Christmas starring Danny Elfman as Jack skellington and Ken Page as the Oogie Boogie man. Obviously there are other characters but we will get into that. This film begins in Halloween Town with our characters doing what they usually do: terrorize everything they can. We meet the majority of characters in this scene including Jack as he essentially is loved by everybody in town, a very exciting opening. The singing that is introduced here continues throughout the movie as Jack along with his ghost dog Zero travel  to the top of a croooked looking hill where we get a pretty cool shot. Then we begin to advance deeper into the story. We meet multiple characters in the next portion of this movie as we meet the love interest Sally, the man Jack lives with Dr. Finklestein, and the semi-comic relief character Mayor who has a double sided face and seems very confused at most times.</div>

          <h4>  the side antagonists are also introduced as a trio of kids working alongside the main antagonist: The Oogie Boogie man. These characters are put aside for a moment however as jack and zero discover a circle of trees in the woods with a bunch of holiday symbols on it. Just Jack enters the tree with the Christmas symbol on it and get transferred from Halloween Town to Christmas Town. Obviously Jack has no idea where he is and is trying to adjust to the snow and happy lights everywhere, and instead of scaring people and wreaking havoc he basks in the happiness of christmas (and takes some things aswell). Here we see the main conflict of the story begin as the three side antagonists Shock, Lock, and Barrel kidnap Santa and attempt to ruin christmas, and all while this is happening the Oogie Boogie man kidnaps Sally with terrible intentions.</div>
            <div id= "block-three">
          <h4>  We arrive at the climax shortly after as Jack and Zero have to battle the Oogie Boogie man and his gang to get Santa and Sally back. During an intense battle jack everntually hooks one of the Oogie Boogie mans strings onto a sharp spinning object thus revealing his insides and finishing him once and for all, Jack saved his girl AND Christmas at the same time. Lock, Shock, and Barrel still roam the streets of Halloween Town however. I give The Nightmare Before Christmas by Tim Burton a 10/10 rating. I have been watching this movie since I was a child and the fantastical and cinematic elements of this movie are things that can only be produced by Burton. I would recommend this movie to any human in the world, I mean who wouldn't wanna watch a Christmas/ Halloween movie. I believe the original animation style and abstract ideas in this storyline make this movie worth the watchand ultimately this film is very amazing to watch in its entirety - O'KeefeGeek
