    <h3>The title of this movie pretty much explains it, this is one of the scariest films I have ever seen and I think it is going to stay that way for a long time. In this movie we follow Ellison (Ethan Hawke) and his family who move into a new home and immidiately find some thing sinister (Pun). With this discovery Ellison meets the Boogie Man, and it gets real nasty from there. If you wanna find out what the Boogie Man really looks like, GO WATCH THE MOVIE!</h3>
