    <h4> Today I will be reviewing a classic that you most likely know of: Jaws. This film directed by Steven Spielburg, Joe Alves, Joseph Sargent, and Jeannot Szwarc is based off of something that many humans fear, however in this movie it is a little bit exaggerated. This movie essentially introduces the problem immediatley as someone gets eaten by the shark in the first scene and the chaos begins. This shark is essentially blood lusted and killing every human he can at the beginning of the movie. There is a scene where it attacks a group of boys at a river and there is a scene where the shark ambushes a large group of people at the beach. All while this is happening our characters are trying to close the beach and make this threat of a shark nonexistent. They run into some problems doing this however due to the mayor of the town refuses to close the beaches to attract more tourists (bad idea) which ends up giving this shark more opportunities to eat. At this point our characters Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and Quint (Robert Shaw) have to go out on a boat to hunt down this shark themselves and use themselves and themselves only to save the townspeople. Our characters attempt to reel in the shark who was given the name Bruce by Spielburg by throwing bait in the water and attempting to track the shark down based on its recent attacks. Here they come to the terrible discovery that this shark is essentially a 25 foot killing machine in a classic scene in which Brody drops the line "You're gonna need a bigger boat."

  <h4>  In the following scenes the men and the shark go head to head in an intense and painful sequence that leaves everything in shambles. Eventually this shark is surrounding and antagonizing the members of the boat and they decide that it is time to take action... however our beloved shark had a similar plan. As Hooper was lowered into a shark cage in the water we saw our first attack which luckily was survived. The next one however did not go so well as the boat nearly sinks and Bruce the shark claims another victim, but loses himself in the process. Brody finishes this battle once and for all when he shoots an airtank stuck in the sharks mouth. Before he does this and we see this fateful film come to an end we get the line from Brody in which he says "smile you son of a..." and then fires the gun. Though some were lost out on the Orca's voyage and all of our surviving characters were left traumatized, Brody, Quint, and Hooper go down as heroes in the town and eliminate Bruce once and for all.... or do they. I give Jaws by Steven Spielburg and company a 7/10 rating, and I know what you are thinking. Though this is a classic movie with an unforgettable storyline, the cinematography and effects are just not efficient compared to the new age films. I believe if I was writing this movie in the 1970's I would have a different opinion but compared to the modern day films this movie is lacking alot of critical aspects in film. I do not recommend this movie for children under 11 years old due to the gore and frightful scenes throughout, however if you are 11+ this film is a must watch. I mean who hasn't seen Jaws, if you haven't seen Jaws leave this site right now and find it somewhere. Like right now I'm serious - O'Keefegeek
