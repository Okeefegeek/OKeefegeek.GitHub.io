<h1>Jon Favreau</h1>
  
  <div class= "dropdown">
     <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">Jon Favreau is a well-known film maker and actor that has acted in movies such as Spider-Man: No Way Home, Daredevil, and Avengers: Endgame.</button>
  <div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
  <p> Jon Favreau has directed several movies that include Iron Man 1 and 2, Elf, and the live action adaptation of The Lion King. I believe Favreau's directing career has some major highlights, however there are also some lowlights that drag his stock down. I believe that Favreau is amazing at painting beautiful scenes in his movies and establishing plots fast and quick. He has also done a great job integrating comedy into some of his more serious movies and writing comedy in the comedy movies. I believe Favreau's strengths are comedy, action, and cinematography and I feel that his weaknesses come in the conclusions of hsi movies. Reviewing his films I realized that alot of these films do not come to an ending that pleases the fans and does not finish the story with power and clarity like other films. Overall I rate Jon Favreau's directing a 7/10 due to his several strengths and weaknesses. - O'KeefeGeek</p>

    <h1>Martin Scorsese</h1>
  <div class= "dropdown">
      <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn"> Martin Scorsese is known around the film world as one of the greatest directors to ever do it and has produced several classics and reeled in top tier actors to excecute roles for him.</button>
  <div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
    
      <p>Martin Scorsese has directed movies such as The Wolf of Wall Street, Raging Bull, and Shutter Island and has not disappointed us once. Scorsese impresses me with his incredible consistency and ability to bring out the best in every actor he works with. Though there is a lack of camera quality which effects several shots in his movies due to the years they were produced Scorsese makes up for it with intense scenes and intricate plots that keep the viewers hooked. One thing that Scorsese does that raises his stock is him bringing in the same actors consistently to give his movies the same feel and develop a signature style such as Leo Dicaprio, Rob De Niro, Willem Dafoe, and Jonah Hill. These actors have made Scorsese almost too much money over the years. Overall I rate Scorsese's directing a 10/10. Scorsese consistently uses top tier actors to make movies with intricate plots and intense scenes along with his impressive cinematography abilities which make him almost a perfect director in my eyes. - O'KeefeGeek</p>

<h1>Jordan Peele</h1>
<div class= "dropdown">
  <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn"> Jordan Peele is a well accoladed director that has explored many genres in his directing career including horror, comedy, and thrill.</button>
  <div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
   
   <p>Jordan Peele is most recognized for his films Us, Get Out, and his acting in the series Key and Peele which all were hits in their respective genres. Peele has many strengths in his directing as he takes on an interesting style of writing and directing in all of his films that deliver intense hooks and mind boggling endings. The cinematography that Peele showcases also hooks viewers as his use of music and build up really built angst and intensity in most of his scenes. Though Peele is an incredible director he is still building his reputation as he has not released as many movies as other Hollywood directors and still has some work to do. Overrall I give Jordan Peele an 8/10 rating as though he does not have much work outhis style of filming and his writing intrigue viewers around the world and he has made several classic movies already in his career of directing. - O'KeefeGeek</p>

<h1>Michael Bay</h1>
<div class= "dropdown">
    <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">  Bay is a well accoladed director that specializes in action films and has not dissapointed to deliver intense and action packed films that have kept our eyes glued to the screen for decades.</button>
  <div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
 
    <p>Michael Bay, who is a master of action films has not failed to deliver heart wrenching plots and engaging action with intense soundtracks over the years. We see Bay peak in movies such as Transformers, Bad Boys, and 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Bay has been previously known to be amazing at developing specific characters and including them into intricate plots in which they typically go through loss and have to recover and face problems throughout their story. Bay also has been a very diverse director as he has incorperated comedy, action, and emotion into his films in a perfect ratio. I believe Bay's strengths do mainly come with the action however, I believe that some of his films do lack the development of side characters and fail to develop antagonists to add any depth to these stories past the main character. With all that being said, I give Michael Bay an 8/10 ranking due to his intense action and ability to provide pure entertainment, Bay also never fails to provide elite soundtracks to his movies to further expand scenes. - O'Keefegeek </p>

<h1>Tim Burton</h1>
<div class= "dropdown">
  <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn"> Burton is a very unique director that has a wide arsenal on films incorperating different styles of filming heavily influencd by early stop-motion methods of the olden days.</button>
  <div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
  <p>Tim Burton, who most people will assume is a bit deranged in the head, is a genius film-maker that has popularized a unique style of filming in his time that is intriguing to say the least. Though Burton has made some outstanding stop-motion films, he has diversified his portfolio beyond belief as he has produced movies such as Batman Returns, Beetlejuice, Sweeney Todd, and Edward Scissorhands. One thing that Burton is extremely good at is establishing mood in his films, during all of his films you can feel a certain energy almost coming off the screen that drastically changes the tone of the film. Burton also impresses me with his consistency, he has produced several classic films one after another and has had actors return to his set several times to act and create masterpieces. I give Burton a 10/10 rating. I say this because he is perfectly conistent, and he has introduced an original style of filming that conveys light and dark moods almost at the same time to ensure that audiences are hooked for the entirety of the film, and that the films convey different messages effectively. - O'KeefeGeek </p>
