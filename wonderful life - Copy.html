    <h4> In the classic film "It's a Wonderful Life" by Frank Capra starring James Stewart and Donna Reed we as viewers go on a journey in which our protagonist George Bailey learns the true value and importance of everybodies life. This is a Christmas movie for the most part but It's still cold so I am reviewing it. At the beginning of this film we see George Bailey as a child saving his brother from downing in freezing cold water (important later on) and essentially going through life blind with an abusive boss at work and a love interest that is introduced. Here we learn all about Georges morals and how good of a person he is. One thing we also learn early on however is that George can't seem to catch a break, he is treated unjustly by about everyone. This trend continues as we catapult into the future to the time of the school dance where George reunites with Mary.

     <h4> With George Bailey's brother now being a war hero and George now being a banker George is still struggling slightly and eager to leave his town and live freely forever. The one thing probably keeping him in his town is Mary (the girl introduced at the start of the movie). Mary has her school dance coming up and George being the loveable guy he is goes to the dance which ends in a pretty weird way as a pool under the school dance floor is revealed and everyone goes for a swim. After the dance we see our characters learn more and more about eachother and eventually fall in love while waltzing throughout the town (Bedford Falls). Long story short our characters get married and live happily ever after. Just kidding they are both miserable in the future as George struggles at work and Mary struggles to take care of the children. Here George begins to hate his daily life as his family, friends, and peers seem to just not be treating him right. George makes a decision here as he decides he wants to take his own life. George attempts to abandon his dream of finding a better life outside of Bedford Falls and jumps off of a bridge just outside of the town. From here the story becomes interesting.

     <h4> George's guardian angel Clarence comes down from the heavens and saves George. Well he doesn't magically bring George back to life but he transports George into an alternate universe where he never existed. In this timeline George's brother is dead, his family is never created, and Bedford Falls is quintessentially 10x more miserable then it was when George existed. Here George realizes that he wants to be alive and begs Clarence to bring him back to his family and friends. Clarence does exactly this and George reunites with his wife, kids, and friends around the town in a jolly Christmas ending. I give It's A Wonderful Life by Frank Capra a 10/10 rating  due to its outstanding writing and plot. Out of all of the films I have watched this one teaches the viewers one of the most valuable lesons of all and deserves to be cherished forever. I recommend this movie for all people and I believe it is a great watch, especially around Christmas. - O'KeefeGeek
