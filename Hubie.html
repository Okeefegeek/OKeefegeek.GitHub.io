<h3>This obviously is besides the fact that Walter Lambert (Steve Buschemi) is roaming around after transforming into a werewolf. After trial and error and a few plot twists along the way Hubie learns many life lessons as the movie comes to a dramatic conclusion.</div>

<h3>I give hubie Halloween a 8/10 rating. I believe that it is a fun family-friendly movie that delivers drama, comedy, and a classic Halloween theme all in one. I would recommend this movie to any Adam Sandler fan along with any fan of mystery films. All around Hubie Halloween by Steven Brills is an amazing watch, especially during October. -  O'KeefeGeek     </h3>
