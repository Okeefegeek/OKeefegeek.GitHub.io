        <h4>
            Jordan Peele is a well accoladed director that has explored many genres in his directing career including horror, comedy, and thrill. Jordan is most recognized for his films Us, Get Out, and his acting in the series Key and Peele which all were hits in their respective genres. Peele has many strengths in his directing as he takes on an interesting style of writing and directing in all of his films that deliver intense hooks and mind boggling endings. The cinematography that Peele showcases also hooks viewers as his use of music and build up really built angst and intensity in most of his scenes. Though Peele is an incredible director he is still building his reputation as he has not released as many movies as other Hollywood directors and still has some work to do. Overrall I give Jordan Peele an 8/10 rating as though he does not have much work outhis style of filming and his writing intrigue viewers around the world and he has made several classic movies already in his career of directing. - O'KeefeGeek
