            Here at O'Keefegeek I am always pleased to hear about a new Toy Story movi-...... wait, something isn't right here; WAIT A MINUTE. A Buzz Lightyear solo film is on the way from Pixar and it looks to top many past Pixar films. Though the film releases in 2022 the hype for it is unreal as the trailer was recently put out. In  this trailer we see a more advanced form of animation compared to past Pixar films and we finally see Buzz in this realistic ultra HD form, and it's very cool. As far as the cast goes we have Chris Evans as Buzz and that is about it, however we can predict that we will have alot of stars voicing in this film.  We do not know that right now however, what we do know is that this movie seems to focus around Buzz traveling to another planet on  A spaceship and attempting to survive. We see two planets in this trailer and Buzz flying around and ecountering other organisms in each one, however we don't get much of a plot line. This trailer concludes with the reveal of the famous spacesuit, which here kinda looks like the armor from Fallout 4. We will see how it looks on Buzz in 2022 however. Though we do not know much about this upcoming movie, we can infer that it will be an action-packed space movie with a very visually pleasing Pixar animation style! - O'KeefeGeek
