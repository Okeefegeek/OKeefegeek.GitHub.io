    <h1><center>Upcoming Movie evaluations:</center></h1>
    <h1><center>Scream 5</center></h1>
    <h5><center>It has been announced, the popular horror icon known as "ghostface' will be making a return to the screen in January as the next Scream movie trailer has been revealed to the public. In this new trailer actors David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Neve Campbell all from the 1996 Scream movie all make an appearance to attempt to take down the new killer. This new movie is sure to deliver the same intensity and mystery as the original Scream movies and it seems as if more depth is now added due to members of the original Scream cast returning. Fans also speculate the return of either Stu Macher (Mathew Lillard) and/or Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) to the screen as ghostface. This is semi valid considering that Ghostface is killing people specifically related to past killers or survivors in past movies. No matter what this movie has in store for us, Scream 5 is sure to deliver intense and thrilling horror back to the screen in January! - O'KeefeGeek  </center></h5>
    <h1><center>Super Mario Movie</center></h1>
    <h5><center>The new Super Mario Movie has been announced and there is now a lot of hype surrounding the I hope animated movie. One thing that is making eyes look towards this movie is the star studded cast with many comedy stars and figures making appearances. We will start with the unexpected sight of Chris Pratt as Mario and Jack Black as Bowser. Here we see starlord and dewey Finn from School of Rock battling eachother for a princess. All while Keegan-Michael Key is on the side as toad helping out (yes that is the guy from Key and Peele). Not to mention me having no idea what Seth Rogan is going to be doing as Donkey Kong, or how Charlie Day will go from drinking with Danny Devito in Philadelphia to being Mario's sidekick. We will see how this plays out and by 2022 we will know the answer to the question: Does Mario ever save Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy)??????? This movie is sure to bring us many laughs and have a fun exhilarating story as this star studded cast has to take on these fun roles! - O'KeefeGeek

    <h1><center>The Batman</center></h1>
    <h5><<center> Yet another Batman movie is in the works and we are getting a new face in the beloved role: Robert Pattinson. Yes that is the guy in Twilight and yes he does look like he can actually play this character well, however he probably can't run as fast as Edward Cullen in the batsuit. One thing that seems to separate this movie from the other Batman movies is the possible R rating that may be added, this is interesting because fans have been longing for decades for a darker more mature DC movie due to the dark themes in DC comics. In past decades directors have not been able to capture the violence and depression around Gotham City that is portrayed in the comics, Matt Reeves is looking to be the first. The cast list is now out to the public for this movie and we see many interesting faces in interesting roles. We see Paul Dano as the Riddler, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Colin Farrell as the Penguin, and Andy Serkis as Alfred Penny. Though those are only a few of the roles in this cast we see alot of talented and known actors in this movie. One last thing I want to talk about is my opinon on this new riddler look. Growing up I believed that no Riddler would ever top Jim Carrey in Batman Forever, but this one looks pretty cool, he seems to be portrayed more as a serial killer more than a goofy villain and he looks very similar to the zodiac killer in this trailer. I believe thatthis riddler will completely change the typical narrative people get when thinking about this character which is great for the DC universe! - O'KeefeGeek   </center></h5>
