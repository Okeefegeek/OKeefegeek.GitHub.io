  <h1>Movie Review: Full Metal Jacket</h1>

    <h3>
    In Stanley Kubrick's critically acclaimed war film 'Full Metal Jacket' we follow the story of a lone soldier named James who early on in the movie is deemed with the nickname Joker. We start this movie in Bootcamp and we end in the very middle of the heated Vietnam war. Joker goes from the worst thing in the world being his Drill Seargent's voice to commonly being shot at and watching his friends dying. This movie does a beautiful job at painting the horrors of War in a way that was allowed to be showed on the big screen. The portion of this movie in the bootcamp introduces us to some of the movies most important characters and really follows the experience of struggling cadet Leonard "Gomer Pyle" who is a bit overweight and uncoordinated. Pyle gets constantly abused and humiliated throughout the camp and eventually he snaps. He and his drill seargent never make it out of bootcamp and from there we transition into the second part of this movie.

    <h3>In the second part of this movie we transfer into the Vietnam War with some new characters in focus: Joker and Rafterman. From here we follow the tragic story of these two along with Private Cowboy, Animal, Eightball, Doc Jay, and Crazy Earl. The main premise of this part of the movie is Joker and Rafterman discovering the true horrors of war and witnessing the death of their brothers and enemies and being as equally traumatized by each one. This movie is trying to send one message and one message only to the viewers: War is Hell. Now I won't spoil much about this movie because I really believe that you should give it a watch, but I can say that the cinematography and plot of this movie easily puts it in O'KeefeGeek's top 10 movies of all time. The first time I watched this movie I knew it was an all time great. Stanley Kubrick paints outstanding scenes and teaches the viewers very valuable lessons in this movie. Though I would not recommend this movie for kids I believe it is an essential for all older viewers to watch and take in, unless you want to join the army - O'KeefeGeek </h3>
