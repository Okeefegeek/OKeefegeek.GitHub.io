            Knives Out by Rian Johnson brought the murder mystery scene back in style in an intense and engaging way. In this film we see a classic murder mystery tale as the death of Harland Thrombey sets a dysfunctional family and a respected detective down a spiraling staircase leading to attempted murder, dissapearances, and Chris Evans getting mad. Our protagonist in our story is Marta who works as the Thrombey's nurse and when Harlan Thrombey drops dead she becomes a key suspect along with everyone else in the Thrombey family. From here Marta and Detective Benoit are heavily intertwined for the remainder of the movie as the Thrombey family is enregaged at the fact that Harlan Thrombey made Marta the inheritor of the Thrombey house which had been owned by the Thrombey family for years.

        <h4> From this point on an intense investigation is launched by detective Benoit. At this point everybody in the Thrombey family is a suspect as at a family party in the past it was revealed that certain characters knew of Thrombey's will and had possible motives to commit murder. Though Thrombey's death was ruled as a suicide it is becoming clear that someone wanted him dead, and as of right now Marta is a prime suspect considering that Harlan died due to poison being in his medicine. But here is where Fran (Harlan's housekeeper) is murdered and Benoit finally begins to put the pieces together. He realizes that it indeed was not Marta who killed Harlan and that Harland genuinly commited suicide after an accident that Marta made. Here is where we discover who this killer is and who was behind all of this mischief: Ransom. Ransom is Harland's grandson and knew of Harland's will and attempted to switch Harland's medicine with a lethal dosage that would kill him. At first detective Benoit is not completly sure who is the killer but it is revealed to be Ransom when he attempts to stab Marta when he is being cornered. Ransom gets arrested and Marta, even through all of the hardships she went through prevailed in the end and found the killer. I give Knives Out by Rian Johnson an 8/10 rating due to its classic nurder mystery style and intense plot along with its outstanding cast. This movie takes you on a journey through the trials and tribulations of a detective faced with a dysfunctional family who all pinned the case on one girl, but in the end justice prevailed. - O'KeefeGeek
