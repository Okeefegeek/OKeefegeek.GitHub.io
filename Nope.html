    <h4> While I was watching the Super Bowl and ya know just chillin on my couch, a specific trailer caught my eye when I saw the interesting opening of a man riding a horse. After fully watching this trailer I can say that Jordan Peele may have another great movie coming into theaters. This film seems to be based around a ranch in the middle of nowhere essentially where a family-owned business is running. One night however, we see that the power goes out and it is discovered that a possibly paranormal entity is coming for the Ranch. From this point on the trailer becomes very confusing as we cannot really identify what this entity is. But as we progress we can clearly see its goal: terrorize the people of this ranch and the people around it. We also see that maybe this cloud looming over the ranch isn't our only threat, we see multiple monster looking people and we are introduced to quite a few characters in this short trailer. Overall there is still alot to be discovered about this movie and a lot of aspects and easter eggs we may not know of. But if we know one thing it is that Jordan Peele is likely cooking up another Horror classic in the same realm as Get Out and US. - O'KeefeGeek
