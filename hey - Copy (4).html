  <h5>The newest addition to the Tom Holland Spider-Man era has been in the works for quite some time now and the official trailer and poster have came out. Though there was not a high demand for a new web slinger film there now is as it has been confirmed that Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx will be making a return to the screen as the Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus, and Electro. This has fans ecstatic for the new movie as the possibility for other villains and even other heroes to arise as roles in this movie is vast. There have been several "leaks" regarding this movie as pictures of Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Holland have surfaced, however none of these images have been proved reliable and some of them have even been proved to be fake. We only have so many guaranteed aspects that will be in this movie aside from theories, but one thing we do know is that we are being set up to see one of the greatest Spider-Man movie ever made, Besides Spider-Man 2 of course
