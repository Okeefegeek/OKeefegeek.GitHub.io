        Shortly after I finished watching Spider-Man: No way Home I waited around for a post credit scene. I got one, well technically it wasn't but it was a pretty good trailer. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness starring Benedict Cumberbatch looks to be a crazy and jaw dropping movie to absolutely stun Marvel fans. There has not been much revealed concerning the cast of this movie however we do know that Scarlet Witch will make an appearance in a possible fight scene with strange. We also know that Wong will return and have an important role in this movie. As far as the plot goes for this movie we do not know that much but we do know that Dr. Strange will be meeting Marvel characters from several other universes and will be meeting alternate versions of himself that may possibly be evil. In the trailer we see Strange fight off several monsters and explore various worlds, we also see Strange and Wong in action while being wounded and dirty implying that our characters are met with something serious in this movie. Overrall we can't really piece together what the plot of movie will be but we can piece together that this movie will be action packed and we will meet new characters and branch farther into the Marvel multiverse than we ever have. - O'KeefeGeek
