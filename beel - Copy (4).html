            <h4>Today I will begin to get into the christmas spirit here on O'KeefeGeek as I will be reviewing my first christmas movie, though you will find out that I am not too fond of this movie I believe the fact that it happens during Christmas makes it all worth it. Holidate directed by John Whitesell starring Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey is a romance film centered around an idea that involves almost no love at all: a holidate. In this movie a holidate is defined as a date that you only bring around for the holidays so your family and friends don't think you are lonely and can't find love.
             <img src= "https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Holidate-1.jpg" width= "350" height= "250"/> 
    Here we meet Sloane (Emma Roberts) who is essentially our lonely person in question. She first is introduced to the concept of a holidate at a family party in which her Aunt who is very popular with the men around town explains and introduces HER holidate. Here Sloanes interest is slightly peaked, but we quickly transition to Jackson's situation (Luke Bracey) where he comes face to face with a maniac girlfriend who is enraged that he does not have any Christmas gifts, and it gets pretty nasty.

            <h4>After both of our characters realize they may be lost romantically this Christmas, they meet at a store at a mall and quintessentially click right away. This culminates on the 2nd floor of the mall in which Jackson gives Sloane his phone number. Eventually our 2 characters become "holidates" and platonically go on random dates during the holidays, Sloane even brings Jackson to one of her family parties which her mother is not too fond of. From this point on in the film we begin to see Jackson and Sloane develop a closer bond with eachother in scenes such as when Jackson posed as her boyfriend in front of Sloanes ex, when Sloane brought Jackson to the hospital, and when Jackson confessed his love in a corny speech... at a SUPERMARKET.

            <h4> How does this all come to a chaotic end you may ask? Jackson and Sloane eventually become a little bit more than just friends. After Sloane essentially dumps Jackson and ends the Holidate, she consults with friends and realizes that he was the right man for her and that she needs him back. This results in a public speech in mall in which she wins him back and the two become a little more than just holidates... like I said, they are lucky this is a Christmas movie. I give Holidate by John Whitesell a 5/10 rating. Though this movie DID get me into the christmas spirit and was an original concept for a movie the pacing in this movie could have been better and the storyline just wasn't as intriguing as I believed it could have been. I would not recommend this movie for kids considering the strong sexual references throughout. I personally would not even recommend this for a grown adult either but if you are looking for a cute movie to chill out and watch while the fire is burning on Christmas, maybe give Holidate a try. - O'KeefeGeek
