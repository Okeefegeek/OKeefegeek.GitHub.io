    <h5> Yet another Batman movie is in the works and we are getting a new face in the beloved role: Robert Pattinson. Yes that is the guy in Twilight and yes he does look like he can actually play this character well, however he probably can't run as fast as Edward Cullen in the batsuit. One thing that seems to separate this movie from the other Batman movies is the possible R rating that may be added, this is interesting because fans have been longing for decades for a darker more mature DC movie due to the dark themes in DC comics. In past decades directors have not been able to capture the violence and depression around Gotham City that is portrayed in the comics, Matt Reeves is looking to be the first. The cast list is now out to the public for this movie and we see many interesting faces in interesting roles. We see Paul Dano as the Riddler, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Colin Farrell as the Penguin, and Andy Serkis as Alfred Penny. Though those are only a few of the roles in this cast we see alot of talented and known actors in this movie. One last thing I want to talk about is my opinon on this new riddler look. Growing up I believed that no Riddler would ever top Jim Carrey in Batman Forever, but this one looks pretty cool, he seems to be portrayed more as a serial killer more than a goofy villain and he looks very similar to the zodiac killer in this trailer. I believe that this riddler will completely change the typical narrative people get when thinking about this character which is great for the DC universe! - O'KeefeGeek </h5>
