    <h1>Movie Review: Nosferatu</h1>

       <h3>Today I am doing a review that in all honesty I didn't know anything about until I watched an episode of Spongebob in middle school. Nosferatu, which is a film that revolutionized horror films in the early 1920's still has significant impact today and in my opinion is still worth the watch. Though this film literally has no audio and all of the dialogue is just text that pops up on the screen, this film is surprisingly eerie and spooky as we watch this tall vampire wreak havoc. The plot of this film is pretty simple as a man named Count Orlok from Transylvania contacts an agent from a small German town claiming that he wants to move into a house across the street. When this agent visits the castle of Orlok in Transylvania he quickly realizes that something is off. After waking up with marks on his neck to discovering that Count Orlok sleeps in a coffin, Thomas Hutter who was sent to meet Orlok flees back to his town after dodging the vampire. From here we see Orlok board and take over a ship to arrive in the town where Hutter and his wife reside, he immediately begins to kill and suck blood and causes mass hysteria in the town. The problem here however is that the people of the town blame these deaths on the plague that is sweeping through the country. </h3>

     <h3>Here is where our film starts to get really spooky, Hutter's wife seems to be the next target of Count Orlok as she almost tries to sacrifice herself to him to defeat him. As Orlok approaches eerily she passes out and is woken up by Hutter to be saved. This movie ends on a weird note essentially as Orlok just dissapears and the town goes back to normal even after the deaths and Hutter, the real-estate agent, and Hutter's wife are left with trauma. I give Nosferatu by Frank Murnau a 9/10 rating, I would give it a 10 but comparing this movie to modern day horror movies there is a large difference in terms of audio and quality. I enjoyed this film due to the fact that it revolutionized the horror genre and even though it was filmed in the 1920's it still is a little bit scary. The eeriness and visuals this film displays definitly unsettle the watchers in an original way that end up having you on the edge of your seat whenever Orlok shows up on the screen. I think Nosferatu is a great watch for all and I believe that it is important to dive into the history of film so that we can further understand modern films. - O'KeefeGeek   </h3>
