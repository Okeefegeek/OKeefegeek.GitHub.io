        <h4>
         The official teaser trailer for Black Adam has been released and though it is very short we gain alot of information. During this trailer we see an exploration crew exploring what looks to be ancient ruins when they stumble upon a carved pattern in the floor. They begin to examine this pattern and are soon greeted by the Rock, or in this movie Black Adam. In the next portion we see Black Adam disintegrate one of the crewmembers and take about 1,000 bullets to the chest and not feel anything. Though that is all we can see for now Black Adam looks to be an intense, original, and fun film in which we see this character come to life. As far as the cast goes we have a couple big names in big roles such as Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate and Aldis Hodge as Hawkman. These characters reveal that there will be a direct antagonist to Black Adam thus needing the support of Fate and Hawkman. Unless Fate or Hawkman ARE the antagonists. We do not know much about this film but we can ensure alot of action and alot of new characters making their debut on the big screen! - O'KeefeGeek
