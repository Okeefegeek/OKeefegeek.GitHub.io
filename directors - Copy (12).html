<h1>O'KeefeGeek's Directors List</h1>
  <h2>(hover over texts for full review)</h2>
<h1>Jon Favreau</h1>
  
  <div class= "dropdown">
<span>Jon Favreau is a well-known film maker and actor that has acted in movies such as Spider-Man: No Way Home, Daredevil, and Avengers: Endgame. Jon has also directed several</span>
  <div class= "dropdown-content">
    <p> movies that include Iron Man 1 and 2, Elf, and the live action adaptation of The Lion King. I believe Favreau's directing career has some major highlights, however there are also some lowlights that drag his stock down. I believe that Favreau is amazing at painting beautiful scenes in his movies and establishing plots fast and quick. He has also done a great job integrating comedy into some of his more serious movies and writing comedy in the comedy movies. I believe Favreau's strengths are comedy, action, and cinematography and I feel that his weaknesses come in the conclusions of hsi movies. Reviewing his films I realized that alot of these films do not come to an ending that pleases the fans and does not finish the story with power and clarity like other films. Overall I rate Jon Favreau's directing a 7/10 due to his several strengths and weaknesses. - O'KeefeGeek</p>

    <h1>Martin Scorsese</h1>
  <div class= "dropdown">
  <span> Martin Scorsese is known around the film world as one of the greatest directors to ever do it and has produced several classics and reeled in top tier actors to excecute roles for him. Scorsese has directed movies such as The Wolf of Wall Street, Raging Bull, and Shutter Island</span>
  <div class= "dropdown-content"
      <p>and has not disappointed us once. Scorsese impresses me with his incredible consistency and ability to bring out the best in every actor he works with. Though there is a lack of camera quality which effects several shots in his movies due to the years they were produced Scorsese makes up for it with intense scenes and intricate plots that keep the viewers hooked. One thing that Scorsese does that raises his stock is him bringing in the same actors consistently to give his movies the same feel and develop a signature style such as Leo Dicaprio, Rob De Niro, Willem Dafoe, and Jonah Hill. These actors have made Scorsese almost too much money over the years. Overall I rate Scorsese's directing a 10/10. Scorsese consistently uses top tier actors to make movies with intricate plots and intense scenes along with his impressive cinematography abilities which make him almost a perfect director in my eyes. - O'KeefeGeek</p>

</div>
<h1>Jordan Peele</h1>
<div class= "dropdown">
  <span> Jordan Peele is a well accoladed director that has explored many genres in his directing career including horror, comedy, and thrill. Jordan is most recognized for his films Us, Get Out, and his acting in the series Key and Peele which all were hits in their respective</span>
 <div class= "dropdown-content">
   <p> genres. Peele has many strengths in his directing as he takes on an interesting style of writing and directing in all of his films that deliver intense hooks and mind boggling endings. The cinematography that Peele showcases also hooks viewers as his use of music and build up really built angst and intensity in most of his scenes. Though Peele is an incredible director he is still building his reputation as he has not released as many movies as other Hollywood directors and still has some work to do. Overrall I give Jordan Peele an 8/10 rating as though he does not have much work outhis style of filming and his writing intrigue viewers around the world and he has made several classic movies already in his career of directing. - O'KeefeGeek</p>
