    <h4>It has been officially released, Spider-Man: No Way Home is out in theaters and O'KeefeGeek just finished watching! Now that I have watched this movie I can say that it has lived up to the hype and left the fans hungry for more. I can now say that I have seen the second greatest Spider-man movie behind Spider-man 3 of course. This movie begins where it left off in Spider-Man: Far From Home as Peter Parker (Tom Holland is trying to escape the media and hate that has stemmed from Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhall) leaking his identity to the world, and it is not going well at all. He is being followed essentially everywhere he goes, his name is being attacked violently everywhere, and his friends were just denied by MIT due to their relations with Spider-Man. Peter can only think of one way to solve these problems, and asks one of the most powerful Marvel characters ever to cast a spell to make everyone forget Spider-Man's identity instead of just asking MIT to let his friends in. As you can predict this ends terribly and essentially all sorts of beings from other universes get dragged into our characters universe and it gets pretty crazy. Here we see the return of multiple villains from past Spider-Man movies such as The Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro, Sandman, and Lizard. Here Peter runs into an issue, he finds out that if Strange sends the villains back to their universe they will die and staying in this universe is the only way to live. Here Peter tries to "cure" the villains by using science! This ends horribly as The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) snaps and causes Sandman (Thomas Hayden) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) to join him. When this happens Spider-Man and Doc Ock are in need of extreme help, and they get it. After Ned (Jacob Batalon) gains powers after stealing Dr. Stranges ring, he is able to drag Peter Parkers from other universes into their own to help combat the villains (Andrew Garfield)(Tobey Maguire). In the scenes after this the three Peter's get to know eachother and each express what they have lost and what they are attempting to gain in the future. But in the present their goal is to cure the villains of their powers and save New York.

    <h4> This all culminates at the statue of Liberty where it is a 4v4 between the three Peters and Doc ock vs. Electro, Sandman, Green Goblin, and Lizard. We see an intense fighting scene with multiple character interactions all ending in 3 out of 4 villains being cured and a fight between Tom Holland's peter and Green Goblin which ends in Tobey's Spider-Man finally showing his good side and saving Green Goblin. Here Green Goblin gets cured and all of the villains and heroes go back to their respective universes. But now there is a final problem, Dr. Stranges spell is changed so that the whole world forgets who Peter Parker is. So now Holland's Peter Parker is alone with no friends or family which is devastating. What makes you believe there will be a fourth Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland you say? Well O'KeefeGeek stayed to watch the post-credit scene and discovered that Venom (Tom Hardy) was lurking in the MCU this whole time and had just released the symbiote into Hollands universe (very exciting). I give Spider-Man: No Way Home a 9/10 rating due to the amazing cinematography and excellent writing paired with the amazing cast and action. I recommend this movie for kids looking to get into superheroes and essentially anyone who already has seen Marvel movies as well. I believe YOU should see this movie as soon as possible and I believe EVERYBODY can be a Spider-Man fan! - O'KeefeGeek </div>
