<h4>
    In the movie His House by Remi Weekes and Matt Smith is an intense mind boggling horror film based in England as an African couple seeking refuge from South Sudan lands in an apartment complex in England knowing very little about English daily life. This film has a very dark grimy mood from the very start as Rial meets a group of boys that verbally harass and torment her for her African accent. This obviously isn't needed at the time as this couple (Bol and Rial) are adjusting to this new life especially with the loss of their "child" Nyagak. The real supernatural horror aspect kicks in when Bol is exploring his home and encounters an entity in an intense scene that had me sweating and biting my nails (not really but you get the point). This is the first scene that separates this fil from other horror movies and builds depth and complexity in the storyline. After yet another encounter with this wall in his house Bol believes that he and his wife are being haunted by evil spirits and decides to burn many valuable pieces of clothing and jewelry inside the house, which deeply upsets Rial.</div>

    <h4>Shortly after while our characters are eating dinner it is revealed that Nyagak died during the crossing between South Sudan and the UK and that our characters feek an extreme amount of guilt relating to the situation. This will become pivotal later in the story. In this moment Bol is trying to grieve less and solve more of this mystery creature lurking in his house. In the following minutes we experience an extremely intense scene in which Bol directly encounters the ghost of Nyagak (and friends) as he is attacked by these spirits. This sets the tone of a large portion of the movie as Bol seems to be mentally and physically battling these ghosts. Though there are many scenes with Nyagak's spirit and others; I want to talk about how this all started in South Sudan.</div>
    <div id= "block-three">
    <h4>One of the most powerful scenes in this movie is the scene during the war in South Sudan. In this scene Bol and Rial have to escape from their country whilst seeing dead bodies of children, seeing gunners rampage through the streets, and seeing fellow citizens attempting to escape. As Bol and Rial load on to a bus to exit the area; gunners begin to drive down the street and shoot people. This causes Rial to save a child (Nyagak) thus separating her from her mother who is gunned down. Even with our characters feeling guilt it can't compare to the feeling of losing Nyagak while crossing. Bol and Rial carry these guilty thoughts and feelings throughout the whole film. This film really just revolves around Bol and Rial's grief and guilt towards the situation thus heavily conflicting them when they find that the spirit haunting them is Nyagak. </div>

    <h4>The biggest problem throughout the film seems to be mentally as Bol and Rial are convinced they are good people though in reality they are a bit crazed and selfish as Mark (The landlord) and us viewers realize throughout. This story ultimately comes to a dramatic climax in which our characters show their true colors (good ones) and permanently defeat the ghosts... or so we think. Overall I give this movie a 9/10 rating due to the advanced cinematography and artistic feel of the film. I also enjoyed how the directors focused a horror film around the real world terrors of war and being a refugee. This film is not very kid friendly but if you are digging a complex deep film that will give you some scares at the same time then His House is perfect for you! - O'KeefeGeek
