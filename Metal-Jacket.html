  <h1>Movie Review: Full Metal Jacket</h1>
  <div class= "block-one">
    <h3>
    In Stanley Kubrick's critically acclaimed war film 'Full Metal Jacket' we follow the story of a lone soldier named James who early on in the movie is deemed with the nickname Joker. We start this movie in Bootcamp and we end in the very middle of the heated Vietnam war. Joker goes from the worst thing in the world being his Drill Seargent's voice to commonly being shot at and watching his friends dying. This movie does a beautiful job at painting the horrors of War in a way that was allowed to be showed on the big screen. The portion of this movie in the bootcamp introduces us to some of the movies most important characters and really follows the experience
