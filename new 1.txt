<h4>In Birds of Prey: Harley Quinn the infamous DC character Harley Quinn, usually being referred to as a side character/smaller antagonist is given a main role on the big screen as Margot Robbie looks to popularize this character. In this movie a newly formed group of heroes teams up to defeat Blackmask (Ewan McGregor) and Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina). The movie does not start with this group together however. The start of this movie focuses on Harley attempting to find a true identity and cope with her new life after being manipulated and controlled by the Joker for years. While doing this she encounters many old friends (not really friends) that have very bad intentions with her, including the police and our first member of the gang: Black Canary. Here Harley begins to finally come to her senses about her past and how screwed she is now that she wrecked Ace Chemicals at the start of the movie. That all contributes to the central conflict of the movie as Roman Sionis is found to be plotting against Harley and after a fun/intense fight scene Harley finds yet another member of our infamous group: Cassandra Cain. Cassandra is a troubled child that has resorted to crime in the streets of Gotham, here Harley takes Cassandra under her wing and as Roman Sionis is back at crime in Gotham Renee Montoya who is a cop actually teams up with Harley to take down crime. Now the conflict of the story revolves around Cassandra as Harley, Renee, Black Canary, and newly gained member Huntress look to defend her from Sionis and Zsasz. Sionis wants Cassandra due to the valuables that she has pickpocketed that he believes belong to him, and he is willing to go far lengths with his partner Zsasz to get her. The majority of the movie from this point consists of intense fight scenes and Sionis and Zsasz closing in on our characters. They miraculously escape every time however and end up making it to the end of the movie in which they encounter Sionis on last time in a fun house, yes you heard it right a fun house. In this fun house they kill several of Sionis's men and eventually Harley has a final standoff against Sionis on a dock and ends this movie long feud once and for all and finally is relieved from the target that was placed on her back after splitting with Joker... or is she. I give Birds of Prey: Harley Quinn directed by Robbie Bryan, Sue Kroll, and Margot Robbie a 6/10. Yes I know this is a harsh rating for a mainly enjoyable movie but I feel like there isn't much to it. It is a redemption story for our character however I believe that there is not enough depth to this story especially with the many mature themes. I believe that if this movie was geared towards a younger audience the rating would be higher but the fact that this movie is geared for a more mature audience and still lacks depth and a more complex storyline makes me give it this rating. All in all I DO recommend watching this movie due to the original fun cinematography displayed in an empowering chaotic film! - O'KeefeGeek     </h4>
