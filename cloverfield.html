<h4>In Cloverfield directed by Matt Reeves, produced by J.J Abrams, and written by Drew Goddard we as viewers expierience an extremely unorthodox film style as something has found and targeted NYC. Actors Michael Stahl David, Lizzy Caplan, and Jessica Lucas take the most major roles in this movie and all deliver quite intense and emotional performances. As our characters are at a party in NYC Rob Hawkins separates from his girlffriend in a fit of rage, he believes this night cannot become any worse (he is terribly wrong). When this party is interrupted by explosions and news reports of a giant creature in the city. This film quickly morphs from a document of the party to a found footage disaster. </div></center> <div id="block-two"><h4>As our characters empty onto the streets of the city chaos insues as buildings collapse, people evacuate, and the first traumatic death occurs as Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) is lost. The mental strain of this situation sets in on Robert as his brother had just died and his girlfriend was in danger, and as the characters inch closer to this unknown creature they realize its true power. Our characters empty into the subway after an intense scene hysteria begins to set in on all of them. But in these dire times they must march on (bad decision).</div><div id="block-three">

  <h4>A critical scene in the movie follows as Marlena gets bitten by an alien creature. Shortly after this our characters run into a military post with more victims of this situation and our characters see the toll this has taken on everybody else, and shortly after we view a dramatic scene where it seems as if our characters might be hopeless. Though our characters are in a hole too deep to dig out of, Robert Hawkins is still out to save Beth (his girlfriend) and will not be stopped. After some time our characters find Beth in probably the worst spot possible and begin to take action. At this point they NEED to get out of NYC and have limited time. At this point our characters Hud, Rob, and Beth find their way on to the same chopper and begin to evacuate NYC and get out alive... Or so we think. Overrall I give Cloverfield by Matt Reeves, J.J Abrams, and Drew Goddard a 9/10 rating. this movie had me hooked about all the way through and had me feeling genuine emotion when characters did. I watched this movie with some friends and usually there would be conversation thus taking some attention off of the movie but during Cloverfield there was not a word. We were all entranced in the film to the point where we weren't talking anymore. I would not recommend this movie for kids as there are violent themes and gore, however if you are a non squeamish teen or adult this movie is a must watch in the future - O'KeefeGeek      </h4></div>
