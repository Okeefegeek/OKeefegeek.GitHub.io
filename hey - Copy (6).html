        <h4>
            Martin Scorsese is known around the film world as one of the greatest directors to ever do it and has produced several classics and reeled in top tier actors to excecute roles for him. Scorsese has directed movies such as The Wolf of Wall Street, Raging Bull, and Shutter Island and has not dissapointed us once. Scorsese impresses me with his incredible consistency and ability to bring out the best in every actor he works with. Though there is a lack of camera quality which effects several shots in his movies due to the years they were produced Scorsese makes up for it with intense scenes and intricate plots that keep the viewers hooked. One thing that Scorsese does that raises his stock is him bringing in the same actors consistently to give his movies the same feel and develop a signature style such as Leo Dicaprio, Rob De Niro, Willem Dafoe, and Jonah Hill. These actors have made Scorsese almost too much money over the years. Overall I rate Scorsese's directing a 10/10. Scorsese consistently uses top tier actors to make movies with intricate plots and intense scenes along with his impressive cinematography abilities which make him almost a perfect director in my eyes. - O'KeefeGeek
