    <h3>In Better Call Saul, we follow the journey of Saul Goodman who is a lawyer in Albuquerque New Mexico. This series is a prequal to 'Breaking Bad' and it follows a lot of similar themes and characters, but the main themes in this series stem from cases that Saul is put on that usually get him involved in some heavily illegal business, but he is the best lawyer in the area for a reason, right?</h3>
