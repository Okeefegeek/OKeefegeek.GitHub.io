    <h4> In Steven Spielburg's adaptation of the H.G Wells novel War of the Worlds, Tom Cruise takes on a protagonist role in a Sci-Fi thriller film for the ages. We start this film in England as a family wakes up to pursue their lives as they always would; however today there is a twist (obviously). Today there are alien spaceships descending towards earth and killing. The alien spaceships land near our families house in the middle of the night and Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is obviously curious as to why there are so many loud bangs and cries coming from that direcction. He soon finds out exactly why as alien ships begin to grab people off of the ground and shoot beams with malicious intent. Here we see our family seek refuge from this force by essentially (not intentionally) splitting up and taking different paths. Here our man Ray finds himself in a house with an older man who is trying to do the same thing as Ray and his daughter: Survive. Here our 2 characters encounter our aliens up close for the first time in an intense scene that will have you sweating and crying out for Ray to survive (not really). The aliens and their machine descend into the basement and here we begin to see the difference between Ray and his basement friend. The man takes a shotgun and aims it at the alien with the intent to kill while ray jumps in and tries to stop him, here we see the two fight in silence as eventually the aliens leave the basement and our character are safe.
<div id= "block-two"> <h4>Here the story begins to evolve into something more than just fighting aliens, we begin to see the difference in morals between humans and what certain people will do just to survive. We see several differences in moral for the rest of the movie as some people have families, some people don't, and some people simply just don't care about any of that due to selfishness. We see everything from dead bodies floating in the river to people jumping in front of cars to stop our family from escaping, all in all this alien invasion takes an especially mental toll on the people of the town. However the main conflict in front of our characters seems to be physical as the alien ships seem to be destroying every possible way out as boats, bridges, and vehicles are being lost. Now you may ask: How do the humans survive these attacks? They simply just wait. Eventually the humans just chill out and the aliens all die from diseases thus ending their reign of terror upon the earth. Here Ray begins to look back on this experience and what happened and realized that in times of an alien invasion, humans began to react differently due to their survival instincts. Many people died due to greed and the natural human instinct to survive, which is quite sad. I give War of the Worlds by Steven Spielburg a 6/10 rating solely due to the lack of quality throughout certain and scenes and lack of the raw emotion that was expressed in the book. I beleive that the storyline was easy to follow and the film was very exciting and action packed in most ways. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially people who have enjoyed fantastical Sci-Fi alien type movies in the past. Though this is a great watch I really hope it is not accurate to what would happen in an alien invasion because in this movie far too many people died that didn't have to, which is a shame - O'KeefeGeek       </h4>
