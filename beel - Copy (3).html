        <h4>
            A new Flash movie has been announced along with a trailer being released and it has been attracting all the hype from DC fans as of late. In our trailer we see multiple things that peak interest as Iris West, Barry Allen, the Reverse Flash, and even the Batman make an appearance. What's even more shocking is that Michael Keaton has been announced as the new Batman. Yes that is the guy that played Batman in like the 1980's. We see Keaton in the cast list and we see the old school batmobile in the trailer. We can predict that multiple members of the Flashes villain arsenal will make an appearance due to the new suit design, and due to the fact that he needs Batman to help him. We also can assume that Supergirl will make an apearance due to Sasha Calle being labeled as her on the cast list. Though the general plot of this movie is unknown and it is not known what they are fighting for, there seems to be a looming threat possibly to Barry's life and/or families life. One thing we do know for sure is that this movie may possibly top the Flash series and take over the box offices when released, and that having Michael Keaton back as Batman will be awesome... even though Danny Devito won't be playing the penguin this time. - O'Keefegeek
