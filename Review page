    <h4>
        In the movie My Friend Dahmer Ross Lynch (former Disney channel star) takes on the role of Jeffery Dahmer in this part psychological crime film. This film obviously revolves around Jeff Dahmer's life as a youngster and how he dealt with the common struggles one wouldn face in their teenage years (he did not do very well). At the very beginning of this movie we can already tell that this guy Dahmer is a little messed up in the head as he openly makes fun of a disabled person and goes out to his personal shed in which he does cruel things to animals all within the first 20 minutes of the movie. Another element of this story that is introduced early is Dahmers odd/dysfunctional relationship with the rest of his family through a scene at the dinner table in which there is also foreshadowing to the future as Dahmer says that he only like to eat the black meat (80% of his victims were black). The next Struggle Dahmer has to face in this movie is his unexciting social life and the bullying he has to deal with. Here he finds 3 friends, including the man that wrote this story John Backderf. In this movie the center conflict is really the deteriorating mental health of Dahmer and how it led to his notorious string of murders, and it starts here. These 3 guys seemed to take Dahmer under their wing in the completely wrong way as the feed off of Jeff essentially freaking out and screaming and yelling randomly at people in the High School. Unfortunately, Dahmer feeds off of this too and thinks making a fool of himself is redeeming and fun. We watch this group of friends roam around the school and town whilst encouraging Dahmer to have these breakdowns. But as he has the whole movie, Jeff feeds off of odd and seemingly immoral pleasures (this continues in the next part). In the next part of this movie the school prom is coming up and people are rushing to get a date for their senior year, as Jeff's friends encourage him to find a date and go to the prom he finds a date in a freshman (bad look). We see our characters roll up to prom looking to have a fun time in the next portion of the movie and Dahmer does not join in. Jeff leaves the dance floor early into the prom and goes to eat a sandwich in a private place.
