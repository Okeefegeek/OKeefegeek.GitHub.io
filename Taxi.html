Travis struggles early on in this film as he points out that he can't sleep, from here his only solution is to drive his taxi around New York picking up people of all kinds and writing in his journal to express his thoughts. Here he meets Betsy, a girl that he ghoulishly stalks as she works to promote the new presidential canidate: Charles Palentine. They end up going on 2 dates and it doesn't end well.</h3>

  <h3>Well anyway's, after this Travis officially spends some time alone to work on himself, he continues to pick up strangers, talk to his cabbie friends, and attempt to really do something with his life. Here he meets another girl: Iris. Iris is a little different than Betsy in the sense that Travis is not in love with Iris, he is trying to save her from a pimp business run by Matthew who is a very interesting character. </h3>
