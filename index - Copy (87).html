<h4> While O'KeefeGeek was in the theater preparing to see Spider-Man: No way Home I caught a trailer that piqued my interest very much. The Morbius trailer which seems to take place in a universe with Spider-Man highlights a character that has in the past not been very popular to MCU fans. This character played by Jared Leto seems to be some sort of vampire that is the result of a failed science experiment. He seems to be able to morph into some creature that can summon bats and eat people. Here in the trailer we meet Michael Morbius himself who is a former doctor and has no idea what is happening to him. He seems to be a good man but something inside of him is inspiring the urge to kill and consume blood. While Morbius is discovering his powers a citywide hunt has gone underway and people around the city are either trying to kill or use Morbius which causes him to become more and more evil in a plot that we have not completely unlocked yet with characters that we have not completely identified yet. Though there is some skepticism and almost no hype around this movie, I believe that the action will be phenomenal and the character development of Michael Morbius will be interesting and possibly tie into the lives of other Marvel heroes! - O'KeefeGeek </h4>
