<h3>I have finally gotten around to reviewing the greatest movie of all time. One of the most beautiful examples of art the human race has ever layed its eyes upon, Morbius. I don't even know where to start with this movie, either with the beautiful cinematography, Jared Leto putting on the performance of a lifetime, or his classic line that will live in film history forever "I'm not Venom". The plot of this movie was pretty simple, Michael Morbius contracted a disease, he tried to fix it, he turned himself and his friend Loxias into vampires, and then all hell broke loose. Did I mention that he is not venom? Anyways, I can not give a great review to this movie because I heard that it was so bad that I shouldn't see it so I didn't. But i'm just going to assume it is a 10/10 so i don't have to go to the theater and relise what it actually is! - O'KeefeGeek  </h3>
