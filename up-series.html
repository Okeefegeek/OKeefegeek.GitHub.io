    <h3>In the new season of Stranger Things we have a new villain introduced, 001 or Vecna in other words. The problem is that in this season our characters are in a different situations, they are all split up, Hopper is stuck in Russia, Jonathan and Will are stuck in California, and Steve and Max are still in Hawkins. This becomes even more of a problem considering each group knows different things that they cannot effectively communicate to eachother across the country. Will our character survive this newly posed threat along with the other creatures still thriving in the Upsidedown? tune in to find out.</h3>
