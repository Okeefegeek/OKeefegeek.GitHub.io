    <h1><center>Scream 5</center></h1>
    <h5><center>It has been announced, the popular horror icon known as "ghostface' will be making a return to the screen in January as the next Scream movie trailer has been revealed to the public. In this new trailer actors David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Neve Campbell all from the 1996 Scream movie all make an appearance to attempt to take down the new killer. This new movie is sure to deliver the same intensity and mystery as the original Scream movies and it seems as if more depth is now added due to members of the original Scream cast returning. Fans also speculate the return of either Stu Macher (Mathew Lillard) and/or Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) to the screen as ghostface. This is semi valid considering that Ghostface is killing people specifically related to past killers or survivors in past movies. No matter what this movie has in store for us, Scream 5 is sure to deliver intense and thrilling horror back to the screen in January! - O'KeefeGeek  </center></h5>
