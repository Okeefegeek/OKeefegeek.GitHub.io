<h5>Adam Sandler AKA Hubie Dubois makes yet another appearance on screen in Steven Brill's "Hubie Halloween". This exuberant and lively film captures the Halloween spirit perfectly as Hubie attempts to fulfill what he feels is his main purpose, keep Salem safe on Halloween. Hubie Halloween delivers several lessons along with action and comedy assuring the viewers of a good watch. As Hubie ventures through some life struggles such as love, fitting in, and bullying, there is a new threat looming on his favorite holiday; Halloween. As kidnappings and disappearances sweep through Salem Hubie feels as if it is his time to shine and protect Salem. With friends, citizens of Salem, and his super thermos. Hubie goes to track the kidnapper and save his people.</div>

<h5>This obviously is besides the fact that Walter Lambert (Steve Buschemi) is roaming around after transforming into a werewolf. After trial and error and a few plot twists along the way Hubie learns many life lessons as the movie comes to a dramatic conclusion.</div>

<h5>I give hubie Halloween a 8/10 rating. I believe that it is a fun family-friendly movie that delivers drama, comedy, and a classic Halloween theme all in one. I would recommend this movie to any Adam Sandler fan along with any fan of mystery films. All around Hubie Halloween by Steven Brills is an amazing watch, especially during October. -  O'KeefeGeek     </h5>
