        <h4>Jon Favreau is a well-known film maker and actor that has acted in movies such as Spider-Man: No Way Home, Daredevil, and Avengers: Endgame. Jon has also directed several movies that include Iron Man 1 and 2, Elf, and the live action adaptation of The Lion King. I believe Favreau's directing career has some major highlights, however there are also some lowlights that drag his stock down. I believe that Favreau is amazing at painting beautiful scenes in his movies and establishing plots fast and quick. He has also done a great job integrating comedy into some of his more serious movies and writing comedy in the comedy movies. I believe Favreau's strengths are comedy, action, and cinematography and I feel that his weaknesses come in the conclusions of hsi movies. Reviewing his films I realized that alot of these films do not come to an ending that pleases the fans and does not finish the story with power and clarity like other films. Overall I rate Jon Favreau's directing a 7/10 due to his several strengths and weaknesses. - O'KeefeGeek</h4>
