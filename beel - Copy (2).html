        Yes you heard it right. Jonah Hill made a movie based on skateboarding, and it's no Tony Hawk Cinderella redemption story. It is actually quite emotional. Sunny Suljic takes on a main role in this film along with Olan Prenatt, Na-Kel Smith, and Ryder McLaughlin as Stevies boys. In this film we essentially see the story of Stevie and how a piece of wood found him a trustworthy group of friends and an escape from his troubled household. Early on in the film we see Stevie begin to look up to a group of older skateboarders and pick up the skill himself. He soon meets the boys for real and adapts a consequential lifestyle in which he gets hurt, gets in trouble, and gets looked down upon... by everyone except his boys which makes it all worth it in his eyes. The boys quickly take Stevie under their wing giving him the nickname "Sunburn" and for Stevie their is no looking back. "Sunburn" learns to skate, goes to parties, and even turns his back on his brother and mom... and yes he does steal his brothers orange juice which is kind of cruel. You should never steal another mans OJ.

       <h4>
        From this point on we are taken on a trip with the boys that involves some outstanding shots, intense scenes, and bad injuries as Stevie tries to ollie a gap and almost breaks his neck. Though this movie is action-packed and we see in a following scene that Stevie and his mom are finally drifting apart more and more; this movie is very short and ends abruptly as our boys get in to a car crash leaving Stevie hospitalized. Though the world seems like it is coming to an end for Stevie he still has the people that he befriended and looked up to in the end as his boys surround his hospital bed for a final scene. In this final scene Fourth Grade who is one of Stevies friends reveals that he has finished a film of skate clips compiled together essentially documenting the boys journey. We as viewers see this film in the ending scene and come to the realization that though this is a very serious emotional story, it is really just based on a group of boys trying to have some fun.

  <h4> I give Mid 90's by Jonah Hill an 8/10 rating due to the intensity and emotion brought into such a simple story. This movie is literrally just about a group of skaters doing dumb things and having fun yet we see multiple outstanding shots, and incredible acting to weave strong emotion into the plot. I would not really recommend this movie for kids due to certain mature scenes and multiple adult themes being used throughout, however to anybody above probably 12 years old this is a great watch and if you decide to turn on Mid 90's be ready for the ride of your life. Maybe you'll pick up a skateboard after aswell! - O'KeefeGeek
